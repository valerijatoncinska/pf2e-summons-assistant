# PF2e Summons Assistant

A module that allows summoning in pf2e to be a lot easier!

_a Thanks to Vauxs for updating [Foundry Summons](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundry-summons) and Sasano for the original macro to handle this partially_

## How it works

This module _generally_ detects a message from a particular item/action/feat/spell that is in it's list, theneither presents the user with a choice of which summon to summon in the case of a `Summon X` spell first, or if it is only a single option or they selected the Summon they want, asks you to place the summon where you want it on the board. This is for the "average" case some cases (IE Wall of Stone) handle themselves a bit differently.
